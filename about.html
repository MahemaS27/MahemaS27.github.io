  <h1>Hey, I'm Mahema.</h1>

      <img class = about_image src="images/IMG_0102.jpeg" align="left">
      I'm a 3rd year Computer Science and Finance Student at
      <a href=https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/ target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Northeastern University.
      </a>
      I'm an aspiring Software Engineer and am currently looking for co-op for Fall of 2020 from June to December. My software interests include musictech & fintech, full-stack,
      and working on projects with interesting data.
      I love working on teams that aim to create a product that has an positive impact.
      Over my time at university, I've become really passionate about supporting women and minorities in the tech industry.

    <h2>Who am I really?</h2>

    <p>
<img class = about_image2 src="images/IMG_1097.jpg" align="right">
      I'm a lot of things. I grew up in Plymouth, MA - hometown of America. I come from a proud Indian family and grew up celebrating Diwali and dancing to Bollywood. Me and my sister are best friends, and my whole family is
      a bunch of comedians. I graduated as the Valedictorian of my
    high school, and entered college with high hopes. I had no prior CS knowledge before coming to NEU, and struggled a lot my first semester. Over time however, I've learned to appreciate
    all the late nights trying to figure out what was the difference between DFS and BFS.</p>

    <h2>Outside of work...</h2>

    <p>I have an addiction to extracurriculars.
      <ul>
     <li>I'm on Kinematix Dance Troupe - Northeastern's premiere hip hop dance troupe. I'm a traditional ballet and Indian classical dancer so joining was a great new challenge.</li>
    <li> Currently I serve as the Vice President for Northeastern Women in Tech - an organization that I'm super passionate about.</li>
    <li>I'm a member of Asian Student Union and South Asian Student Union. Cultural orgs were a must for me when I came to NEU.</li>
     </ul>
